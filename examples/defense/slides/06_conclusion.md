# Conclusion

- This dissertation describes the Embodied Worldmaking process, an integrative method for bridging embodied natural experiences through immersive media performance. This process, grounded in somatic movement practice, is a dynamic creative method for navigating and prioritizing the body and Earth in relationship with technology.

- The practice-based research contributes four performance worlds that have led to the clarification of the Embodied Worldmaking process and the creative coding system, Seer. These works showcase the possibilities of both this creative method and Seer.
