// Welcome everyone, thank you for all being here today. I am really excited to be sharing with you my dissertation work: embodied worldmaking -- bridging body and earth through immersive media performance.
// Before I begin, I would like to start by bringing our attention to the lands beneath our feet, and to acknowledge the indigenous peoples of the land where you are now. I am lucky to be in Goleta, CA, home of the Chumash people, and I would like to extend my respect and gratitude to the Chumash community, past, present, and future for their care of this land. My work at its heart is a collaboration with this land and I feel truly grateful to witness it knowing that the care, life, and beauty of the Chumash people is reflected in my experience of the land today -- and I feel a responsibility to connect with, listen to, and love the land and all of its creatures as a members of my own family.

# abstract
Embodied worldmaking explores the transdisciplinary creative intersection of embodied movement practice, known in the field of somatics, with virtual worldmaking performance and media arts practice. This research integrates diverse methods into a framework for creating immersive media performative artworks inspired from the body and the natural world that aim to create spaces of refuge for re-connecting to the whole body and sharing embodied stories of interconnectivity with land. This framework takes the form of the embodied worldmaking process, a set of integration methods prioritizing the body in relationship with creative expression, media arts practice, and interactive technology. Specific methods are shared for connecting embodied movement practice, embodied interaction design, performative virtual worldmaking practice, and creative coding system design.

- Background and Related Works
-- Embodiment + Somatics to Embodied Interaction + Soma Design
-- Worldmaking + Ecology to Virtual Worlds + Biomimetic Programs
-- Creativity Support Tools for Embodied Worldmaking
- Works
-- Kinetrope / Becoming Light / Meditation Mirror / Terrarium
- Embodied Worldmaking Process and Methodologies
- Seer System Design: Creative Coding for Embodied Worldmaking
- Conclusion

// Here is an overview of the defense.
// We will start with the underlying motivations, problems, and research questions 
// Next, I will go over related work in embodiment, somatics, dance and HCI, as well as the concept of worldmaking and important media artworks and worlds. I will also look at the background of creative system design tools and methods important to this work.
// I will then look at the 4 media art works that comprise the practice based research of this dissertation: Kinetrope, Becoming Light, Meditation Mirror and Terrarium
// Followed by an overview of the Seer Creative Coding language built as a result of these artworks, as a necessary design tool to empower the process of creating embodied worlds
// I will then describe the integrative methods of the Embodied Worldmaking process, which are generalized from the process of making embodied worlds, and worldmaking process

"As electric media proliferates, whole societies at a time become discarnate, detached from mere bodily or physical 'reality' and they are relieved of any allegiance or sense of responsibility to it or for it. In the electric age, the alteration of human identity by a new service environment of information has left whole populations without personal or community values..."
-- Marshall McLuhan

// Although McLuhan wrote these words in a different era of electric media early in the emergence of personal computers, its sentiments still hold true today with a clear poignancy. McCluhan suggests disembodiment as a symptom of an underlying design flaw in how we create and use technology, and ultimately how it leads to a disconnection from personal and shared values.

# motivation

- Mind dislocated from Body (Cartesian dualism)
- Society/Economy dislocated from Ecology (Capitalism)
- Technology that reinforces existing patterns of dislocation

// Our usage of technology and our immersion in environments shaped by humans grows more and more prevalent. At the same time, the effects of the anthropocene on the whole planet are undeniable as we witness human driven changes and global warming radically shift the face of the Earth and its stability as a living organism.

// The processes of division and dissection are an important foundation of scientific learning, however these same processes become dangerous when we lose sight of the whole and indivisible nature of living systems.

// Kate Raworth, a renegade economist, describes a piece of the solution: "we need to shift the idea that success lies in endless growth to success lies in balance, meeting human needs within planetary boundaries...the big metaphorical opportunity of our time, if we are are going to thrive with and as part of this planet, is to connect what we understand about bodily health to planetary health". 
___
# problem
- utilize technology to heal patterns of dislocation in the body and our environment
-- Integrating embodied movement and ecological listening practices with media arts immersive worldmaking practices to create regenerative narratives and spaces of refuge that prioritize the connection of body and Earth.
-- Designing creativity support tools to empower the integrative practices above

// practice-based research

___
# research questions
- How can embodiment and somatic practices integrate with media arts creative practices in order to inform, empower, and prioritize whole body experiences?
- How can ecological listening practices integrate with media arts worldmaking practices to create spaces for valuing the connection between body and Earth?
- How can creative coding systems be designed to empower the practice of embodied worldmaking, using programming languages to create embodied interaction with virtual worlds inspired by ecological experiences?

___ 
# contributions
- Four media artworks and embodied worlds exploring somatic and biomimetic processes: Kinetrope, Becoming Light, Meditation Mirror, and Terrarium
- Seer, a novel creative coding framework for rapid prototyping immersive audiovisual ecologies and embodied interaction instruments
- The embodied worldmaking process, an integrative method for prioritizing body and Earth in combining embodied movement, ecological listening, and media art worldmaking practices
