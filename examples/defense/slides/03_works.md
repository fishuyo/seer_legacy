# kinetrope
- kinein -> (movement)  tropos -> (turning)
- tropism -> the turning of an organism in response to an external stimulus, i.e. heliotropism, geotropism...
- kinetrope is a virtual plant like organism that grows towards moving bodies detected by a depth camera motion tracking system
- algorithm based on Space Colonizing Growth (Runions et al 2007)

___
# kinetrope system design
- started with implementation of the growth algorithm 
  -- takes point cloud as input to grow branches towards
- implemented user tracking api in Seer using OpenNI and Kinect depth camera
- connected Kinect point cloud data to growth algorithm
- created an interface to record resulting kinetrope data

___
# embodied movement scores
- inspired by moving outside in collaboration with living trees over a period of years
- self-reflexive movement scores explore becoming-tree: 
-- visualizing root growth
-- slowing down, returning to ground, aligning and growing
-- BNPs: cellular breathing, pulsation, yield, push, reach, pull
- explored movement without feedback and with visual feedback
  -- found resulting forms much more compelling from explorations without visual feedback
  -- however, without feedback you may not get results due to not be aware of certain limitations of the system

# Terrarium
- explores group interaction in an immersive ecology
- utilizes atmospheric fields and fluid simulation as interactive medium
- multi-camera Kinect tracking system to cover a large area
- movement and stillness insert colored elements into atmosphere
- trees and small bacteria grow and move in relationship with these elements
