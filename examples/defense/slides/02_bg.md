# Embodiment and Somatics

- Embodiment: 
  -- "investment in or manifestation through a physical body; a bringing into or presentation in or through a form."
- Embodiment as phenomenology:
  -- "is the participatory process of existing as a living body, awareness of the body, and awareness through the body, engagement with meaning, and agency in relationship to self and other."

___
# Field of Somatics
- Somatics is the field which studies the soma or body as perceived from within. (Hanna 1976)
- includes many diverse practices, methods, and schools of somatic inquiry
  -- Body-Mind Centering, Feldenkrais Method, Alexander Technique, Yoga, Qigong, Aikido
- focus on agency in self-healing and re-patterning through heightened sensory-motor awareness
- somatics includes: somatic psychology, somatic bodywork, and somatic movement (Eddy 2009)
- many early pioneers coming from modern dance and performance contexts:
  -- Francois Delsarte, Emile Jacques-Dalcroze, Rudolf Laban, Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, Anna Halprin

//- field of somatics in western world emerged in early 1900s from numerous pioneers seeking answers to bodily needs, illness, and trauma
//- field growth supported by phenomenology, modern dance, eastern martial arts and yoga

___
# Body-Mind Centering
"Body-Mind Centering is an integrated and embodied approach to movement, the body and consciousness. Developed by Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen, it is an experiential study based on the embodiment and application of anatomical, physiological, psychophysical and developmental principles, utilizing movement, touch, voice and mind. Its uniqueness lies in the specificity with which each of the body systems can be personally embodied and integrated, the fundamental groundwork of developmental re-patterning, and the utilization of a body-based language to describe movement and body-mind relationships."

# Body-Mind Centering
$lh -0.01
- Body systems:
-- Skeletal, Ligaments, Muscular, Organs, Endocrine, Nervous, Fluids, Fascial, Skin, Cellular
- Embryological processes and developmental movement
- Basic Neurocellular Patterns (BNP): 
-- prevertebrate patterns: Vibration, Cellular Breathing, Sponging, Pulsation
-- vertebrate patterns: spinal movement, homologous movement, homolateral movement, contralateral movement
-- yield, push, reach, and pull

- Embodiment process:
-- "Embodiment is the awareness of the cells themselves. It is a direct experience. There are no intermediary steps or translations. The brain is last to know."
-- visualization: guiding through imagination to inform embodied experience
-- somatization: guiding through movement and touch to inform embodied experience

// "The process of embodiment is a being process, not a doing process, not a thinking process. It is an awareness process in which the guide and witness dissolve into cellular consciousness." (Bainbridge Cohen 1993) 
// "Experience happens first at the cellular level and then is recorded in the nervous system.. when we direct from the brain, what we do is based on past experience.."
// "which can limit our receptivity in the present moment. When we begin from a place of receptive not-knowing, our past experience can inform rather than direct the process."

___
# Anna Halprin and RSVP cycles
- Anna Halprin is a pioneer of postmodern dance
- Strong use of improvisational methods and breaking rules of dance, considered somatic movement pioneer
- RSVP cycles as creative method
  -- Resources: materials and ideas used in the process
  -- Scores: instructions for the work
  -- Valuaction: dynamically responding to the work based on values
  -- Performance: setting the work in motion
- connected her creative process to her own healing
- strong connection to nature as teacher, ritual, and myth in creating scores

// Planetary Dance
// "I believe if more of us could contact the natural world in a directly experiential way, this would alter the way we treat our environment, ourselves, and one another."

# Authentic Movement
- Authentic Movement is an improvisational movement practice started by Mary Starks Whitehouse (1950s)
- connections to Jungian philosophy and to somatics as a form of dance therapy
- Outer witnesses hold a container of focused attention in support of movers
- Movers Practice a deep listening, letting go into whatever movements want to be moved
- a space for consciousness to meet and dance with unconscious processes

# Embodiment and Human Computer Interaction 
- Paul Dourish connects HCI to embodiment through phenomenology (Dourish 2001)
- grounded in phenomenology, tangible computing, and social computing
- "Embodiment is the property of our engagement with the world that allows us to make it meaningful"
- "Embodied Interaction is the creation, manipulation, and sharing of meaning through engaged interaction with artifacts." 
- "you cannot separate the individual from the world in which that individual lives and acts"
- Embodied interaction introduced a new way of seeing HCI, however very limited grounding in knowledge of the physical body,internal processes, anatomy, and movement

___
# Kinaesthetic Creativity
- Kinaesthetic Creativity: "body's ability to enact alternate future possibilities via movement" (Svanaes 2013)
- Understanding Kinaesthetic Creativity in Dance:
 -- research on modes of kinaesthetic creativity in relationship with interactive visual systems outlines a taxonomy of creative movement relationships (Hsueh et al 2019)
 -- relationship to visual system: instrument, partner, or medium
 -- relationship to self: reactive or self-reflexive

// in reactive movements, dancers move in response to constraints set by particular contexts, for example, the conic space delineated by Kinect’s range of capture. In self-reflexive movements, dancers turn their attention from the external environment back to the movement itself: instead of conforming to situation-relative constraints, dancers place the primacy back on movement
// a shift of focus, creates a shift of agency.
//- all interaction is embodied

___
# Somaesthetic Appreciation Design (2016)
- Kristina Hook connects somatic practice (Feldenkrais 1972) to interaction design via somaesthetics (Shusterman 2000)
- through a series of autobiographical designs generalized shared design qualities
- qualities of Somaesthetic Appreciation Design:
  -- Subtle guidance: directing attention inwards
  -- Making space: places for reflection
  -- Intimate correspondence: feedback that follows rhythm of the body
  -- Articulating experience: means to share experienced bodily sensations

// subtle guidance: guiding attention without distrupting agency, offering choices rather than limiting outcomes
// making space: reflect both physical space of safety, doorway to making space inside for new experiences
// intimate correspondence: immediacy and synchronization is key. expressed as an implicit interaction and flow

# Worldmaking
$lh -0.015
- Worldmaking is cosmopoiesis
  -- cosmos: multi layered meaning, world as orderly systematic whole
  --- cosmos: universe
  --- cosmos: as ornament (world of cosmetic)
  --- cosmos: people of a city as ornament (cosmopolitan)

- worlds are made of worlds
 --- "...if worlds are as much made as found, so also knowing is as much remaking as reporting" (Nelson Goodman, Ways of Worldmaking 1978)
 --- reality, fiction, dream, and myth
 --- resonance and reverberation (Bachelard 1958)
- Umwelt - "the world as it is experienced by a particular organism, self-centered world" (Jakob von Uexküll)
 --- autopoiesis
- Biosphere + Ecology - interconnected relationships of worlds
 --- making kin + sympoiesis (Donna Haraway)

___
# myth as worldmaking
"It has always been the prime function of mythology and rite to supply the symbols that carry the human spirit forward, in counteraction to those that tend to tie it back." 
-- Joseph Campbell (Hero with a Thousand Faces)

// stories and symbols that move us, that resonate in us a deep connection to values that drive us towards ourselves and that supply connections to positive futures

___
# Worlds and Restorative Experience
- Restorative experience and self-regulation in favorite places (Korpela et al 2001)
  -- reflects the interconnection of self and environment
  -- co-regulation occurs in response to places of refuge
- Restorative Effects of Natural Environment Experiences (Hartig et al 1991)
  -- immersion natural environments reduces mental fatigue
- Restorative effects of virtual nature settings (Valtchanov et al 2010)
  -- simulated natures can create

// directed attention vs undirected attention (effortless attention and fascination)
// Fascination refers to the capability of the environment to allow the rest of the attentional
system, by means of the stimulation of an effortless attention.

"Artificial Nature is an installation series and research project by Haru Ji (South Korea) and Graham Wakefield (UK), creating a family of interactive art installations surrounding humans with biologically-inspired complex systems experienced in immersive mixed reality. The invitation is to become part of an alien ecosystem rich in networks of complex feedback, but not as its central subject. Although artificial natures are computational, we draw our inspiration from the sense of open-ended continuation and the aesthetic integration of playful wonder with the tension of the unfamiliar recalled from childhood explorations in nature."

# related works: Connected Worlds (2015)

"Connected Worlds is designed to encourage a systems thinking approach to sustainability where local actions in one environment may have global consequences. Children work with a fixed amount of water in the system and have to work together to manage and distribute the water across the different environments. Clouds return water from the environments to the waterfall which releases water to the floor when it rains."

# related works: Dokk (2017)
"Dökk is the upshot of three years of work aimed at the creation of a work capable of stimulating a sense of profound empathy, transmitting two key concepts: the synchronicity and the unforeseeableness of human existence. In order to obtain this result, a system has been developed capable of elaborating the result of close interaction between various data generated in real time on the stage: the analysis of sound, the movement of the performer, his/her heartbeat and the sentimental analysis of contents shared on social networks. The combination of these data thus ensures that every performance takes on ever different and unique connotations as a result of the random, unforeseeable nature of the information analysed."
