# Embodied Worldmaking Methods

___
# Embodied Worldmaking Process
- a multi-layered making process rooted in body and Earth and shared through immersive performance
- 6 paradigms / phases of the process
-- Ideation and inspiration
-- Virtual sketching and biomimicry
-- Embodied instrument design
-- World bridging scores
-- Performance world composition
-- Performance / Exhibition
___
# Key Principles of Integration
- integrates principles of RSVP cycles from Lawrence Halprin to organize creative process:
-- Resources, Scores, Valuaction, Performance
- integrates principle qualities seen in Somaesthetic appreciation design (Hook 2016):
-- Subtle Guidance
-- Making Space
-- Intimate Correspondences
-- Articulating Experience
- integrates principles of Bachelard's 'Poetics of Space' (1958)
-- Resonance
-- Reverberation

___
# Key Principles of Integration
- Novel integrating metaphor becoming-tree points to:
-- Slowing Down + Presence
-- Attention + Senses: identifying yes + no
-- Intention + Direction: prepares 
-- Agency + Maslow's hierarchy of needs

- becoming-tree scores:
-- Return to Ground: body and Earth
  --- rooting in presence and place
  --- score of valuaction included throughout the process
  --- it is the initiation point in becoming-tree
  --- the process starts here, and returns here 
-- Align and Grow: supporting agency towards intention 

___
# Paradigm 1: Ideation and Inspiration
- Resources:
-- embodied phenomenological experience in relationship with land
-- poetic maps of emergent stories connecting my own body to the land
- Scores:
-- Meeting Place, Authentic Movement
-- Poetic Mapping: tracking and tracing embodied memory

___
# Paradigm 2: Virtual Sketching
- from the ground of poetic mapping
- Resources:
  -- creating virtual sketches towards poetic experiences
  -- implementing physical and biomimetic simulations to generate resonant qualities
- Scores:
  -- Dailyworlds: improvisational live-coding practice

___
# Paradigm 3: Embodied Instrument Design
- Extending virtual sketches into the world through interactive devices
- Creating possibility for whole-body interaction
- Resources:
  -- audiovisual instruments
  -- embodied interaction mappings
  -- embodied experience with instrument as knowledge of affordances and limitations
- Scores:
  -- Making Space: space to engage virtual and body
  -- Rapid exploration of mappings: 
    --- live-coding in Seer + sampling interaction data
    --- from reactive to self-reflexive engagement

___
# Paradigm 4: Bridging Worlds
$lh -0.02
- Messy and chaotic phase, transition between roles, and worlds
- focus moving from virtual as instrument towards virtual ecologies
  --- integrating multiple sketches into an instrument ecology
  --- identifying parameters of distinct resonant qualities
  --- move from engagement as instrument to engagement as medium
- re-exploring and retrieval of body and Earth scores as basis for self-reflexive engagement
  --- idea of carrying the land in the body
- feel the pressure of the gaps, and sit in it, from both sides

- Resources:
  --- New poetic map of resonant qualities connecting parameters of the virtual ecology and embodied movement in relationship with original poetic map of body and Earth
  --- New movement scores in relationship with virtual ecologies
- Scores:
  --- Return to Ground
  --- Finding Balance


___
# Paradigm 5: Performance Composition
- differentiating virtual ecology into distinct environments
- organizing and connecting environments in space and time
- connecting embodied movement scores to environments
- recording poetry or missing pieces from poetic maps
- revisiting place and field recordings
- Resources:
-- Embodied world performance system
-- Performance score
- Scores: 
-- Inhabiting and Evolving

___
# Paradigm 6: Performing
- there is a letting go here, a silence and a stillness
- there is a making space within me, as a witness to the audience and myself
- there is a carrying of the land in my body
- there is an invitation to participate
- there are words that come to guide
- Resources:
 -- shared improvisational experiences
- Scores:
 -- Making space
 -- Return to ground
 -- Inhabiting world
 -- Subtle guidance

// it is a similar experience to Paradigm 1
