// programming is so mental, how to make it embodied... to program in space, with space, with environment, to build processes --- like to physically build programs.... or computational processes, or ecologies, relationships....

// wow when i switched from journal to seer project, and thinking in code, just really cut my flow,
// allowing comments to provide a narrative of thought
// allowing code to be more literary...

// narrative comments are a step forward, but more as poetic scaffolding
// to code in not language modality, graphical for instance, is actually lower level in some way, althought the components are higher level, the are lower level in being more closely relatable to something embodied, things existing as bodies, or highly organized living systems --- to interact at an embodied scales prioritizes our heirarchy of knowing, and capacity for different ways of knowing..
// both absstractions...
// language a mental -- audio/visual/symbolic technology
// picture - a perceptive capacity, although symbolized as well -- information is represented in intentionaly representations of structure visually, so seing it is perceived, but then abstracted as representation of a structured process...

// there is clarity of intention in language..?
// there is more clarity of function in space...?
// hmm time for bed.. what are you talking about.... even...


// todo write a program that accomplishes the goal:
  // clear intention: demos recording motion data from devices through loop buffer into a audiovisual score of some sort, demos both designing the mapping in code, and improvising the resulting instrument --> gather and recording material for composition

  // connects reader to their body
  // uses metaphor that connects writer at time of writing to own body
