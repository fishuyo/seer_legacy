        <h3>embodied worldmaking</h3>
<li>Welcome everyone, thank you for all being here today. I am really excited to be sharing with you my dissertation work: embodied worldmaking -- bridging body and earth through immersive media performance.</li>
<li>Before I begin, I would like to start by bringing our attention to the lands beneath our feet, and to acknowledge the indigenous peoples of the land where you are now. I am lucky to be in Goleta, CA, home of the Chumash people, and I would like to extend my respect and gratitude to the Chumash community, past, present, and future for their care of this land. My work at its heart is a collaboration with this land and I feel truly grateful to witness it knowing that the care, life, and beauty of the Chumash people is reflected in my experience of the land today -- and I feel a responsibility to connect with, listen to, and love the land and all of its creatures as a members of my own family.</li>

        <h3>abstract</h3>
<li>Embodied worldmaking explores the transdisciplinary creative intersection of embodied movement practice, known in the field of somatics, with virtual worldmaking performance and media arts practice. This research integrates diverse methods into a framework for creating immersive media performative artworks inspired from the body and the natural world that aim to create spaces of refuge for re-connecting to the whole body and sharing embodied stories of interconnectivity with land. This framework takes the form of the embodied worldmaking process, a set of integration methods prioritizing the body in relationship with creative expression, media arts practice, and interactive technology. Specific methods are shared for connecting embodied movement practice, embodied interaction design, performative virtual worldmaking practice, and creative coding system design.</li>

        <h3>overview</h3>
<li>Here is an overview of the defense.</li>
<li>We will start with the underlying motivations, problems, and research questions</li>
<li>Next, I will go over related work in embodiment, somatics, dance and HCI, as well as the concept of worldmaking and important media artworks and worlds. I will also look at the background of creative system design tools and methods important to this work.</li>
<li>I will then look at the 4 media art works that comprise the practice based research of this dissertation: Kinetrope, Becoming Light, Meditation Mirror and Terrarium</li>
<li>Followed by an overview of the Seer Creative Coding language built as a result of these artworks, as a necessary design tool to empower the process of creating embodied worlds</li>
<li>I will then describe the integrative methods of the Embodied Worldmaking process, which are generalized from the process of making embodied worlds, and worldmaking process</li>

        <li>Although McLuhan wrote these words in a different era of electric media early in the emergence of personal computers, its sentiments still hold true today with a clear poignancy. McCluhan suggests disembodiment as a symptom of an underlying design flaw in how we create and use technology, and ultimately how it leads to a disconnection from personal and shared values.</li>

        <h3>motivation</h3>
<li>Our usage of technology and our immersion in environments shaped by humans grows more and more prevalent. At the same time, the effects of the anthropocene on the whole planet are undeniable as we witness human driven changes and global warming radically shift the face of the Earth and its stability as a living organism.</li>
<li>The processes of division and dissection are an important foundation of scientific learning, however these same processes become dangerous when we lose sight of the whole and indivisible nature of living systems.</li>
<li>Kate Raworth, a renegade economist, describes a piece of the solution: "we need to shift the idea that success lies in endless growth to success lies in balance, meeting human needs within planetary boundaries...the big metaphorical opportunity of our time, if we are are going to thrive with and as part of this planet, is to connect what we understand about bodily health to planetary health".</li>

        <h3>Body-Mind Centering</h3>
<li>"The process of embodiment is a being process, not a doing process, not a thinking process. It is an awareness process in which the guide and witness dissolve into cellular consciousness." (Bainbridge Cohen 1993)</li>
<li>"Experience happens first at the cellular level and then is recorded in the nervous system.. when we direct from the brain, what we do is based on past experience.."</li>
<li>"which can limit our receptivity in the present moment. When we begin from a place of receptive not-knowing, our past experience can inform rather than direct the process."</li>

        <h3>Kinaesthetic Creativity</h3>
<li>in reactive movements, dancers move in response to constraints set by particular contexts, for example, the conic space delineated by Kinect’s range of capture. In self-reflexive movements, dancers turn their attention from the external environment back to the movement itself: instead of conforming to situation-relative constraints, dancers place the primacy back on movement</li>
<li>a shift of focus, creates a shift of agency.</li>
<li>- all interaction is embodied</li>

<li>making space: reflect both physical space of safety, doorway to making space inside for new experiences</li>
<li>intimate correspondence: immediacy and synchronization is key. expressed as an implicit interaction and flow</li>
